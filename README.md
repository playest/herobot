This software is a Telegram bot that notify me when files change on my hard drive. It serve as a cross-platform notification system by running the bot on a server and writing updates every X minute (via cron) in a file.

To run it: ```TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="TOKEN" RID="ID_OF_AN_EXISTING_CONVERSATION_WITH_THE_BOT" cargo run```

TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN can be obtained by talking to BotFather on Telegram.

ID_OF_AN_EXISTING_CONVERSATION_WITH_THE_BOT must be found with an other software for now.
