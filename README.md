This software is a telegram bot that notify me when files change on my hard drive. It serve as a cross-platform notification system by running the bot on a server and writing updates every X minute (via cron) in a file.

To run it: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=`TOKEN` RID=`ID_OF_AN_EXISTING_CONVERSATION_WITH_THE_BOT` cargo run`

ID_OF_AN_EXISTING_CONVERSATION_WITH_THE_BOT must be found with an other software for now.
